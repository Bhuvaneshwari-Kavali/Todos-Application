# Todos Application

## Project Overview
The **Todos Application** is a dynamic and interactive web app built to help users manage tasks efficiently. Users can add, view, delete, and prioritize their tasks in a simple and intuitive interface. This project is an example of practical usage of modern front-end development techniques, showcasing skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **local storage** for persistent data handling.

The app was created as part of project-based learning to gain hands-on experience with core web development concepts and build real-world functionality that can be expanded over time.

## Features
- **Add New Tasks** – Users can add tasks with a description.
- **Delete Tasks** – Ability to remove tasks once completed.
- **Persistent Storage** – Tasks are stored in the browser’s local storage so data persists across page reloads.
- **User Friendly UI** – Simple interface for quick task management.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Markup structure of the application.
- **CSS3** – Styling, responsive layout, and improved user experience.
- **JavaScript** – Logic for task creation, deletion, UI updates, and local storage integration.
- **Local Storage** – Browser storage used to save tasks permanently.

## How It Works
1. User enters a task in the input box.
2. On clicking **Add**, the task gets displayed in the task list.
3. Tasks are saved in local storage so that they remain available after page reload.
4. Users click the delete button to remove tasks.

## Code Highlights
- Dynamic DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- Event listeners to capture user inputs.
- Usage of localStorage to read and write task data.
- Functions to update UI and storage on every action.
